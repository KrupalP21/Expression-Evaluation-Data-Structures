# Expression-Evaluation-Data-Structures

Using stacks and recursion to do evaulate expressions that are stored in text files in Java. Project at Rutgers University-New Brunswick for Sesh Venugopal in CS112 Data Structures.

## Objective

Input an expression, then input a text file that has the values for the variables in the expression. The program requires you to scan the expression inputed and sort each variable in an index of an array and assign coressponding values from a text file. Then you must evaluate the expression using PEMDAS which requires the utilization of recursion and stack implementation in order to handle cases with multiple parentheses and operations.
